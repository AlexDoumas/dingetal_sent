fat shelf drove light
wood girls shine skin
tan lamps rubs eggs
gold fur stole steak
dry fox cook notes
sly chefs wrote trees
top boss plant kids
our teams love hope
two moms give nests
all plans built bugs
new ants hunt dogs
large apes claw tea
teen cats brewed time
rude cooks waste girls
rich games hurt ships
fun toys tied you
pink waves hear shoes
huge ears hit hearts
deaf aunt hide hate
his words ate blood
kind fight leak holes
long sharks dig jeans
dead dogs like tests
smart kids fail cups
slim boys warm bread
sick doors make town
rear hands fill chefs
pale smells smack grass
bad foes caused food
mad lamb brings flies
quiet fork miss stars
soft frogs show camp
green skies flee hills
black beer climb cents
tall goat costs speech
gray guys gave tears
iced kings shed gas
old eyes need doors
blue cars closed plates
white child hang cars
young threads sold milk
thin store drink cows
their cubs lost cheese
cute farms cuts germs
six knife killed mom
sharp soap scared hats
round sound wear walls
loud clowns paint streets
weird sons cross hums
her bears sang worms
giant dudes caught space
drunk bags take rooms
little chick cleaned roads
brown maids block farms
four rocks ruined snow
big flood melts tires
fierce ground slash bills
warm blades paid fear
keen friends sensed cans
poor rat holds trucks
