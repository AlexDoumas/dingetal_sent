fat rat sensed fear
wood shelf holds cans
tan girls drove trucks
gold lamps shine light
dry fur rubs skin
sly fox stole eggs
top chefs cook steak
our boss wrote notes
two teams plant trees
all moms love kids
new plans give hope
large ants built nests
teen apes hunt bugs
rude cats claw dogs
rich cooks brewed tea
fun games waste time
pink toys hurt girls
huge waves hit ships
healthy ears hear you
his aunt tied shoes
kind words warm hearts
long fight caused hate
dead sharks leak blood
smart dogs dig holes
slim kids like jeans
sick boys fail tests
rear doors hide cups
pale hands make bread
bad smells fill town
mad foes smack chefs
quiet lamb ate grass
smooth fork brings food
green frogs miss flies
black skies show stars
tall guys flee camp
gray goat climbs hills
iced beer costs cents
old kings gave speech
blue eyes shed tears
white cars need gas
young child closed doors
thin threads hang plates
their store sold cars
cute cubs drink milk
six farms lost cows
sharp knife cuts cheese
round soap killed germs
loud sound scared mom
weird clowns wear hats
her sons paint walls
giant bears cross streets
drunk dudes sang hums
little chick caught worms
brown bags take space
four maids cleaned rooms
big rocks block roads
fierce flood ruined farms
warm ground melts snow
keen blades slash tires
poor friends paid bills
